# C-Bus MQTT Integration Development Log

## Project Overview
Development of a Home Assistant custom integration for Clipsal C-Bus lighting control via MQTT bridge.

## Work Completed

### 1. Repository Setup & GitHub Actions
- ✅ Set up GitHub repository with proper structure
- ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow for validation (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`)
- ✅ Configured automated testing with:
  - HACS validation
  - Python linting (flake8, black, isort)
  - Code formatting standards
- ✅ Fixed multiple formatting issues and GitHub Actions failures

### 2. HACS Configuration
- ✅ Created `hacs.json` with proper configuration
- ✅ Made repository public for HACS compatibility
- ✅ Updated all placeholder URLs from `yourusername` to actual repository
- ✅ Integration successfully appears in HACS store

### 3. Home Assistant Integration Structure
- ✅ Created proper custom component structure:
  ```
  custom_components/cbusmqtt/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── config_flow.py
  ├── const.py
  ├── manifest.json
  ├── light.py
  ├── switch.py
  ├── fan.py
  └── cbus/
      ├── __init__.py
      ├── coordinator.py
      └── interface.py
  ```

### 4. Configuration & Manifest Files
- ✅ Properly configured `manifest.json` with:
  - Domain registration
  - Dependencies (MQTT)
  - IoT class (local_push)
  - Requirements (paho-mqtt, pyserial, asyncio-mqtt)
- ✅ Created comprehensive configuration files
- ✅ Added proper versioning and metadata

### 5. Component Implementation
- ✅ Implemented basic light, switch, and fan platforms
- ✅ Created C-Bus coordinator for device management
- ✅ Built MQTT bridge functionality
- ✅ Added configuration flow for setup wizard

### 6. Code Quality & Standards
- ✅ Applied Black code formatting
- ✅ Fixed import sorting with isort
- ✅ Added `pyproject.toml` for tool configuration
- ✅ Resolved all linting issues
- ✅ Maintained Python 3.9+ compatibility

### 7. Security Review
- ✅ Conducted comprehensive security audit
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in repository
- ✅ All credentials are placeholder values only
- ✅ Safe for public repository

## Issues Encountered

### 1. GitHub Actions Failures
- **Problem**: Multiple formatting and linting failures
- **Solution**: Applied Black/isort formatting, created tool configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 2. HACS Validation Errors
- **Problem**: Invalid fields in hacs.json
- **Solution**: Removed domains/iot_class from hacs.json (belongs in manifest.json)
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 3. Config Flow Registration Issues
- **Problem**: "Invalid handler specified" error when adding integration
- **Attempts Made**:
  - Fixed duplicate __init__ methods
  - Updated class inheritance patterns
  - Added proper handler registration
  - Updated to modern Home Assistant patterns
  - Added import_executor: false to manifest.json
- **Status**: ❌ Unresolved - Integration appears in HACS but fails to load

## Current Status
- ✅ Repository is public and appears in HACS
- ✅ All code quality checks pass
- ✅ No security issues
- ❌ Config flow fails with "Invalid handler specified"

## Decision: Complete Restart
Due to persistent config flow issues, starting fresh with a new, minimal integration focused on core functionality:
- C-Bus device discovery
- MQTT state synchronization  
- Light control (on/off/brightness)
- Button press state return

## Next Steps
1. Archive current implementation
2. Build new minimal integration from scratch
3. Focus on core C-Bus + MQTT functionality
4. Test thoroughly before adding advanced features
